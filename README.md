# AutoUpdateViaVersion
AutoUpdateViaVersion is a plugin for Minecraft servers that automatically updates the ViaVersion plugin to the most recent successful build. [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) is a Bukkit plugin that allows players using different Minecraft versions to play together on the same server.

# Current Features
- Compatible with Minecraft versions 1.8 and higher, including the latest versions.

- Automatically downloads successful builds of ViaVersion from Jenkins.

# Planned Features
- At the moment, there are no planned features for future releases of AutoUpdateViaVersion. However, if you have a suggestion or feature request, please create a new issue in the project's GitHub repository.

# Installation

Download the latest release of the plugin from the releases page.
Copy the downloaded .jar file to the plugins directory of your Minecraft server.
Restart the server.
AutoUpdateViaVersion does not require any configuration or setup. Once installed, it will automatically update ViaVersion to the most recent successful build whenever the server starts.

# Note
Please be aware that this plugin currently needs the server to be started twiceâ€”once to install the plugin and again to actually load it. I did, however, find a solution to this but it will take me sometime before releasing the fixed release sorry.
